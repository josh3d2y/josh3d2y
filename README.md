Iâ€™m graduating with a degree in **Network Operations and Security** at **Western Governors University (WGU)**, with over 5 years of IT experience across industries like **federal**, **fintech**, and **healthcare**.

### My Expertise:

- **System & Network Monitoring**: With experience using platforms like **Datadog**, **Splunk**, **Wireshark**, and **MKToolbox**, I have built and maintained dashboards that track the health and performance of critical infrastructure. These monitoring tools have been pivotal in preventing downtime and maintaining security across high-traffic applications.

- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Iâ€™ve worked closely with **DevOps**, **NetOps (Network Engineers)**, **Database Administrators**, **Product Managers/Owners**, **Directors of IT**, and **Help Desk** teams, ensuring smooth coordination during incidents and system changes.
